Part of my daily routine involves tackling a CodeWar challenge at or above my current kyu (ranking). I am currently seeking additional practice with string methods and arrays.

## Optimizations

I constantly revisit the coding challenges I have solved, in order to seek new ways to optimize my solutions for maximum efficiency.

## Lessons Learned:

Tackling CodeWars challenges on a daily basis has taught me how to persevere against the unknown, and to never hesitate in seeking help when I most need it.
